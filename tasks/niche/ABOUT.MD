# üîß Niche Tasks Category

Specialized coding challenges that require domain-specific knowledge and expertise.

## Overview

This category tests AI models on specialized areas of software development that require deeper domain knowledge. These aren't your typical web app tasks - they're the kind of work that requires understanding of specific technologies, protocols, or domains.

## Subcategories

### üóÑÔ∏è LevelDB Operations (5 tasks)

**Focus:** Working with LevelDB, a fast key-value storage library

**What is LevelDB:**
- High-performance key-value database
- Used in Chrome, Bitcoin, and many other applications
- Embedded database (no separate server process)
- Sorted storage by keys

**Typical Tasks:**
- Reading and writing LevelDB databases
- Data migration between databases
- Backup and restore tools
- Performance optimization
- Integration with applications
- Batch operations
- Iterator patterns

**Common Libraries:**
- plyvel (Python)
- leveldown/levelup (Node.js)
- goleveldb (Go)
- leveldb (C++)

**Path:** `tasks/niche/leveldb/`

### üîç Reverse Engineering (5 tasks)

**Focus:** Analysis and understanding of existing systems

**Types of Tasks:**
- Binary analysis and decompilation
- Protocol reverse engineering
- File format analysis
- API reverse engineering
- Malware analysis (benign samples only)
- Firmware extraction and modification
- Network protocol analysis

**Tools & Techniques:**
- Ghidra / IDA Pro
- Binary Ninja
- Wireshark for protocol analysis
- Python for automation
- Frida for dynamic analysis
- Radare2

**Ethical Considerations:**
- All tasks use legal, benign samples
- Focus on learning and security research
- No malicious use cases
- Educational purpose only

**Path:** `tasks/niche/reverse-engineering/`

## What These Tasks Test

‚úÖ **Domain Expertise**
- Understanding of specialized technologies
- Ability to work with niche tools and libraries
- Domain-specific best practices

‚úÖ **Problem-Solving**
- Handling complex, specialized requirements
- Debugging in unfamiliar domains
- Research and learning ability

‚úÖ **Production Quality**
- Not just proof-of-concepts
- Real-world robustness
- Performance considerations
- Security awareness

## Why Niche Tasks Matter

Models that excel at mainstream web development might struggle with:
- Less common libraries and frameworks
- Domain-specific terminology
- Specialized best practices
- Performance-critical code
- Security-sensitive implementations

These tasks reveal whether a model has genuine broad capabilities or just memorized common patterns.

## Task Structure

Each niche task directory contains:
- **prompt.md** - Task description with domain context and requirements

**Evaluation:** Tasks are evaluated by human reviewers with domain expertise using the criteria defined in the main README.md. Domain-specific considerations (e.g., smart contract security, ML model architecture) are factored into the scoring.

## Contributing

When adding niche tasks:
1. Ensure the domain is genuinely specialized
2. Provide necessary context (but not solutions)
3. Focus on practical applications
4. Include domain-specific success criteria
5. Consider security and ethical implications
